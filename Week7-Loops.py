# Here are some short tasks to practice writing different types of loops in Python:
# 1. For Loop: Print numbers from 1 to 10



# Write a for loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10.
# 2. While Loop: Count Down from 10


# Write a while loop that counts down from 10 to 1 and prints each number.
# 3. For Loop: Even Numbers between 1 and 20


# Write a for loop that prints all even numbers between 1 and 20.
# 4. While Loop: Sum of Numbers



# Write a while loop that adds numbers from 1 to 100 and prints the total sum.
# 5. For Loop with List: Square Numbers
# Write a for loop that iterates through a list of numbers and prints the square of each number.
# 6. Nested Loop: Multiplication Table
# Write a nested for loop that prints a multiplication table for numbers 1 to 5.
# 7. While Loop: Find Factorial
# Write a while loop that computes the factorial of a number (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).
# 8. For Loop: List of Strings
# Write a for loop to iterate over a list of words and print each word in uppercase.
# 9. Break and Continue: Skip Even Numbers
# Write a loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10 but skips the even numbers using continue.
# 10. For Loop with Range: Sum of Numbers
# Write a for loop that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 50 using the range() function.
# 11. While Loop: User Input
# Write a while loop that repeatedly asks the user to enter a number and prints it until the user enters 'stop'.
# 12. Nested Loop: Print a Triangle of Stars
# Write a nested for loop that prints the following pattern of stars:
# *
# **
# ***
# ****
# *****
# These tasks cover a range of basic looping concepts, including for and while loops, nested loops, and common loop control statements like break and continue.
